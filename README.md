# name-generator
Python program for the system tray that lets you easily copy silly names

This will allow you to have a silly name copied to your clipboard from the taskbar.
Since I don't have a linux machine, this is made for windows only.

Download the zip file and unzip it wherever you want. Run main.py to start it. Make sure pip is installed *before* running it. If you don't have it, the program will crash. The first time you run it, some terminal windows may pop up. That's just pip installing the modules.

Next, a menu will pop up on your screen. Fill it out with your name and preferences. When you press save and close, a red circle will appear in the taskbar.
Click it to get a name copied to your clipboard.
Right click to get a menu: Close the program or change your settings. Everytime after your first time, starting the program will go straight to the red circle.

I suggest adding main.py to your startup folder. It's much smoother that way. Use Ctrl-R then enter "shell:startup" to open the startup folder. Copy a shortcut to it and that's it.
